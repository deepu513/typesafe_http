# typesafehttp

Typesafe HTTP calls from flutter/dart

## Getting Started

`master` branch contains stable code, some cleanup needs to be done, which I will do in my free time.

`experiments` branch has a lot of experimental code with logging interceptors, header interceptors session expired callbacks to logout from the application, the code is highly unstable though. I will be working on it in my free time.
